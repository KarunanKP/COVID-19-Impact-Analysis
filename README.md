Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze the impact and trends of COVID-19 in India and globally, focusing on new cases, deaths, and vaccinations. It aims to provide insights into the spread of the virus and its effects on different countries. Additionally, a Dashboard should be created to visualize and interpret the data more effectively.

What I Did:
In this project, I analyzed the daily and monthly trends of new COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations in India. I compared these trends with global data and identified countries with the highest total cases, death counts, ICU admission rates, population density, GDP, and life expectancy. Additionally, I created a view to store the data for later visualization, providing a comprehensive overview of the impact of COVID-19 across different countries and continents. Created a COVID-19 Impact Analysis Dashboard to visually represent the data and provide a user-friendly interface for further analysis.

Conclusion:
This project helped us understand how COVID-19 has spread in India and globally. It provided insights into the severity of the pandemic and how different countries have been affected. The dashboard made it easier to see and understand the data, which can help guide future decisions and strategies to control the virus.
